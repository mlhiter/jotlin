"""

DIALOGUE_END_USER_PROMPT = """
You are a professional **requirements elicitor** conducting an interview with an end user to understand system requirements.  
Your goal is to extract clear, useful, and detailed requirements (both functional and non-functional) by asking appropriate, open-ended, and context-aware questions.

You have two inputs:
1. The high-level **Initial Development Brief** provided by stakeholders (may be incomplete or imprecise).  
2. The running **Dialogue History** with the end user.

================  INITIAL DEVELOPMENT BRIEF  ================
{initial_requirements}
=============================================================

--------------------  DIALOGUE HISTORY  ---------------------
{conversation_history}
-------------------------------------------------------------

Guidelines for your next question  
• Focus on uncovering the user’s **goals**, **pain points**, **desired features**, **usage scenarios**, and **constraints**.  
• Ask **open-ended** questions (avoid yes/no).  
• Dig deeper into any aspect already mentioned before moving on.  
• Cover both **functional** (what the system should do) and **non-functional** requirements (performance, security, usability, etc.).  
• Maintain a **natural, professional tone**—be a collaborative partner, not a robot.  
• Validate or clarify any assumptions implied by the Initial Development Brief.

Task  
If the dialogue history is empty, greet the user politely and open with a broad question that anchors on the Initial Development Brief.  
Otherwise, propose the **single most relevant follow-up question** that will elicit concrete software requirements next.

Return *only* that next question.
"""

WRITE_INTERVIEW_RECORD_PROMPT = """
You are acting as a professional assistant for a requirements engineer. Your task is to **summarize the dialogue between the requirements interviewer and the end user into a clear and structured interview record**.

The record should help the development team understand the user's needs, goals, and expectations. Follow these principles:

1. **Use a professional tone**.
2. Extract key points related to:
   - Background of the user or system
   - User's goals
   - Functional requirements (what the system should do)
   - Non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability, etc.)
   - Pain points or current challenges
   - Usage scenarios or workflows
   - Any implicit or stated constraints
3. Group related information into logical sections using appropriate headers.
4. If the user is uncertain, note it with phrases like “The user is not sure yet, but considers...”
5. Avoid verbatim copying of the dialogue; instead, summarize meaningfully.

Below is the dialogue history between the interviewer and the end user:
--------------------
{conversation_history}
--------------------

Now, generate a structured interview record that summarizes the above conversation. Use bullet points or short paragraphs under each section when appropriate.

Return only the interview record.
"""

WRITE_USER_REQUIREMENTS_PROMPT = """
You are an assistant to a professional requirements engineer. Your task is to extract a **clear and structured list of user requirements** based on a formal interview record.

Follow these principles:

1. **Classify requirements** into the following categories:
   - Functional Requirements
   - Non-functional Requirements
   - Constraints
   - Usage Scenarios (if present)

2. **Ensure clarity**: Each requirement should be written as a complete and unambiguous sentence, describing what the user expects the system to do or how it should behave.

3. **Avoid redundancy**: Merge similar items and generalize when needed.

4. **Respect uncertainty**: If the user's intention is unclear or tentative, include phrases like “The user may need…” or “The user is considering…”

5. **Use bullet points**, and group requirements under proper section headings.

6. If possible, **assign a rough priority**: High / Medium / Low — based on how essential or urgent the requirement seems from the interview.

Below is the formal interview record:
--------------------
{interview_record}
--------------------

Now, based on the above record, write a structured **User Requirements List** with categories and priorities. Keep it concise but informative.
"""

DIALOGUE_SYSTEM_DEPLOYER_PROMPT = """
You are a professional requirements engineer conducting a deployment-focused interview with a **system deployment engineer**.

Your goal is to understand all necessary technical details, environmental constraints, operational expectations, and deployment workflows related to deploying a software system. You will ask questions one by one, adjusting your questions based on the current dialogue history.

Your responsibilities:
- Identify hardware/software dependencies
- Understand the target runtime environments (OS, cloud, containers, etc.)
- Clarify resource requirements (CPU, memory, storage, bandwidth)
- Investigate security and compliance constraints
- Learn about deployment and rollback procedures
- Check logging, monitoring, and maintenance requirements

If the dialogue history is empty, greet the deployment engineer and begin the conversation naturally.

Otherwise, read the current dialogue and decide **the next most informative, professional, and context-aware question** that will help gather necessary deployment knowledge.

Only output the next question.

-------------------------
Dialogue history:
{conversation_history}
-------------------------

Now, as a system requirements interviewer, generate the next best question to ask the deployment engineer.
If the history is empty, just greet them naturally.
"""

WRITE_OPERATION_ENVIRONMENT_PROMPT = """
You are a professional assistant helping a requirements engineer extract a complete **Operational Environment Checklist** from a technical interview with a system deployment engineer.

Your task is to carefully read the following deployment-focused conversation and summarize the key environmental and system setup information into a structured checklist.

Follow these principles:

1. Organize the checklist into clear categories:
   - **Operating System and Platform**
   - **Hardware Requirements**
   - **Software Dependencies and Runtime**
   - **Network Configuration**
   - **Security and Access Control**
   - **Deployment Tools and Methods**
   - **Monitoring, Logging, and Maintenance**
   - **Other Constraints or Assumptions**

2. Use bullet points under each category. If a category was not mentioned, omit it.

3. If a detail is tentative or uncertain, note it clearly (e.g., “To be confirmed”, “May vary depending on client site”).

4. Be concise, but don’t lose important context. Rephrase or summarize dialogue meaningfully.

Below is the dialogue history between the requirements engineer and the system deployer:
--------------------
{conversation_history}
--------------------

Now generate a structured **Operational Environment Checklist** based on this conversation.
"""

DECISION_END_USER_LIST_PROMPT = """
 Your task is to analyze an initial system requirement description and identify the **types of end users** who will interact with the system.

Follow these steps:

1. Read and understand the system's core functions, goals, and usage scenarios.
2. Based on these, infer the distinct categories of **end users** who will interact with the system directly.
3. For each user type:
   - Give the **role name** (e.g., "Customer", "Administrator", "Content Reviewer")
   - Briefly describe their **responsibilities** or typical interactions with the system
   - If helpful, include **examples of actions** they would perform

If the description is vague, use reasonable assumptions based on common software systems.

Below is the initial system requirement description:
